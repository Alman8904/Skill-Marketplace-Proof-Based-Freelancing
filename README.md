# Skill Marketplace — Backend API

A **reputation-based freelancing platform** REST API built with Spring Boot. Consumers hire providers for specific skills, payments are held in escrow until work is approved, and every user builds a public trust profile automatically from their order history.

## How It Works

1. **Register** as a `CONSUMER`, `PROVIDER`, or `ADMIN` (admin is auto-created — not user-selectable)
2. **Providers** list skills from the admin-managed catalog, setting hourly rate, experience, and service mode (`REMOTE`/`LOCAL`)
3. **Consumers** search providers by skill name with optional filters (rate range, service mode, experience)
4. **Consumer places an order** → specifies estimated hours → `agreedPrice` is auto-calculated as `rate × hours`
5. **Consumer authorizes payment** → funds are deducted from wallet and held in escrow
6. **Provider accepts** the order (only possible after payment is authorized) and sets a deadline
7. **Provider starts work** → status moves to `IN_PROGRESS`
8. **Provider delivers** → submits delivery notes and a URL
9. **Consumer approves** → funds released to provider wallet atomically → order is `COMPLETED`
10. **Trust scores** are computed automatically from order history — no manual ratings needed

## Key Features

### Escrow Payment System
Money moves in three steps only — authorize → capture → (or) refund. Funds are locked between authorization and delivery approval, protecting both parties.

### Abuse Protections
- `deliveryUrl` hidden from consumer until order is COMPLETED — prevents taking work without paying
- Refund blocked once provider has accepted — consumer cannot pull funds mid-job
- Provider acceptance blocked until payment is authorized
- Delivery URL validated with `@Pattern` — must start with `http://` or `https://`, cannot be blank

### Automated Expiry Scheduler
`OrderExpiryScheduler` runs every hour and handles two stuck-money scenarios:
- **Provider missed deadline** — order is ACCEPTED or IN_PROGRESS and deadline has passed → auto-refund consumer, cancel order
- **Consumer ghosted after delivery** — order has been DELIVERED for more than 3 days → auto-capture payment to provider, complete order

### Trust & Reputation System
Scores calculated automatically from order history — no star ratings needed.

| Badge | Criteria |
|---|---|
| `NEW` | No order history yet |
| `TRUSTED` | Completion rate ≥ 80% and zero refunds |
| `NEUTRAL` | Completion rate ≥ 50% |
| `RISKY` | Completion rate < 50% or significant refunds |

## Database Schema

Flyway runs all migrations automatically on startup.

```
category (1) ──────────────────────────────> skill (N)
                                               │
user_model (1) ─────────────────────────────> user_skill (N)

user_model ──────────> orders <──────────── user_model
  (as consumer, 1:N)            (as provider, 1:N)

orders (N) ──────────────────────────────── skill (1)
```

**Tables:**

| Table | Key Columns |
|---|---|
| `user_model` | id, username, password, user_type, wallet_balance |
| `category` | category_id, category_name |
| `skill` | id, skill_name, category_id |
| `user_skill` | user_skill_id, user_id, skill_id, rate, experience, is_active, service_mode, description |
| `orders` | order_id, consumer_id, provider_id, skill_id, agreed_price, estimated_hours, deadline, status, mock_payment_id, mock_payment_status, delivery_url, delivery_notes, + timestamps |

**Migrations:**

**Authorize body:**
```json
{
  "orderId": 5,
  "amount": 150.00

> Amount must exactly match `agreedPrice` on the order. Refund is blocked once a provider has accepted — this prevents consumers from pulling funds out mid-job.

## Payment Flow

```
Consumer adds funds to wallet
         │
         ▼
Consumer authorizes payment for order
  ├── Funds deducted from consumer wallet
  ├── Held in escrow
  └── Payment ID generated: PAY_XXXXXXXX
         │
         ▼
Provider accepts order (blocked until payment = AUTHORIZED)
         │
         ▼
Provider delivers → Consumer approves
  ├── Funds added to provider wallet (atomically in same @Transactional)
  └── mockPaymentStatus = CAPTURED

  ─── OR ───

Consumer cancels (while PENDING only)
  ├── Funds returned to consumer wallet
  └── mockPaymentStatus = REFUNDED
```

---

## Order Lifecycle

```
[Consumer places order]
         │
         ▼
      PENDING ──► Consumer can cancel here (auto-refunds if paid)
         │
[Consumer authorizes payment]
         │
[Provider accepts + sets deadline]
         │
         ▼
      ACCEPTED ──► Auto-cancelled if provider misses deadline (consumer refunded)
         │
[Provider starts work]
         │
         ▼
    IN_PROGRESS ──► Auto-cancelled if deadline passes (consumer refunded)
         │
[Provider delivers (notes + URL)]
         │
         ▼
     DELIVERED ──► Auto-completed after 3 days if consumer doesn't approve (provider paid)
         │
[Consumer approves delivery]
         │
         ▼
     COMPLETED ──► Provider wallet credited
```

## Security & Roles

**Authentication is stateless JWT.** Login returns a plain JWT string. Send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on all protected endpoints.

| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| `CONSUMER` | Place orders, authorize/refund payments (PENDING only), cancel pending orders, approve deliveries, search providers, view trust scores |
| `PROVIDER` | List skills, accept/start/deliver orders, view received orders |
| `ADMIN` | Create/update/delete categories and skills. Auto-created on startup via `DataInitializer`. |

**CORS is pre-configured for:**
- `http://localhost:5173` (local dev)
- `https://skill-marketplace.onrender.com` (production)

**Exception handling** is centralized in `GlobalExceptionHandler`:

| Exception | Status |
|---|---|
| `ResourceNotFoundException` | 404 |
| `BadRequestException` | 400 |
| `ForbiddenException` | 403 |
| `ConflictException` | 409 |
| `UnauthorizedException` | 401 |
| `MethodArgumentNotValidException` | 400 (with field-level error map) |
